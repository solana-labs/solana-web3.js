# @solana/programs

This package contains helpers for identifying custom program errors. It can be used standalone, but it is also exported as part of the Solana JavaScript SDK [`@solana/web3.js@next`](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/tree/master/packages/library).

## Functions

### `isProgramError()`

This function takes any error — typically caused by a transaction failure — and identifies whether it is a custom program error from the provided program address. It takes the following parameters:

-   The `error` to identify.
-   The `transactionMessage` object that failed to execute. Since the RPC response only provide the index of the failed instruction, we need the transaction message to access its program address.
-   The `programAddress` of the program from which the error is expected.
-   Optionally, the expected error `code` of the custom program error. When provided, the function will also check that the custom program error code matches the given value.

```ts
try {
    // Send and confirm your transaction.
} catch (error) {
    if (isProgramError(error, transactionMessage, myProgramAddress, 42)) {
        // Handle custom program error 42 from this program.
    } else if (isProgramError(error, transactionMessage, myProgramAddress)) {
        // Handle all other custom program errors from this program.
    } else {
        throw error;
    }
}
```
