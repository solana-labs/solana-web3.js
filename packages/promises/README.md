# @solana/promises

This package contains helpers for using JavaScript promises.

## Functions

### `getAbortablePromise(promise, abortSignal?)`

Rejects if the `abortSignal` is aborted before the promise settles. Resolves or rejects with the value of the promise otherwise.

```ts
const result = await getAbortablePromise(
    // Resolves or rejects when `fetch` settles.
    fetch('https://example.com/json').then(r => r.json()),
    // ...unless it takes longer than 5 seconds, after which the `AbortSignal` is triggered.
    AbortSignal.timeout(5000),
);
```

### `safeRace(...promises)`

An implementation of `Promise.race` that causes all of the losing promises to settle. This allows them to be released and garbage collected, preventing memory leaks.
